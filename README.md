Hi, I'm a software engineer, and this is where my pet projects live.

* Currently working on a toy C++ database / storage engine for my potential future web search engine project. I've been wanting to implement web search for so long, the web has changed twice over :)
* I also maintain my own cross-platform (Win / Linux / Mac) [dual-panel file manager](https://github.com/VioletGiraffe/file-commander).
